## About
This is a mini project for SC1015 (Introduction ot Data Science and Artificial Intelligence). Our main focus is on games from Steam.
## Dataset Used
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mexwell/steamgames
## Problem Definition
1) Find out what type of video games are successful
2) Find out common themes/factors that make them successful 

## Models used
1) Classification
## Conclusion and Insights
### Conclusion
1) Able to find out what factors affect sales (game ownership)
2) Able to narrow factors down to Metacritic scores
3) Use Metacritic scores to predict success of a game
4) Able to utilise our data and RNN to assist with generating a game description 
### Insights
1) Shorter game length -> Lower ownership
2) Free games -> Higher ownership as they are more accessible
3) Price of a game does not predict success.
4) Niche games should be avoided.
